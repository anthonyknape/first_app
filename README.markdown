# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: first application

This is the first application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*] (http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Anthony Knape] (http://socketbox.us).

Inspiration for this endeavor flows from the failed success of [Matt Groening] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Groening).
